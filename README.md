# Pokémon Rescue 🌟

## How to Set Up and Run the Application  

### Step 1: Clone the Repository  
First, clone the repository using the following command:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jagadeesh-18-bot/Pokedex-application
```
### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
To run the application smoothly, create a virtual environment and install the required packages.

Use the following command to create a virtual environment named poke_env:
```bash
python3 -m venv poke_env
```
Now, activate the environment using:
```bash
source poke_env/bin/activate
```
### Step 3: Install Required Packages
Next, install the necessary Python modules PySide6 and Requests using the following commands:
```bash
pip install PySide6
pip install requests
```
These modules are essential for running the application.
### Step 4: Run the Application
Now, you are ready to run the application! Use the following command to start it:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
And that’s it! The Pokédex application is now up and running. 🎉
## Final Submission 🏆
- The application now works as expected:
  1. **Search Pokémon:** Enter a Pokémon name to fetch its details.
  2. **Display Details:** View abilities, stats, and more in the main window.
  3. **Capture Pokémon:** Save Pokémon to a collection and view all captured Pokémon in a separate window.
## For the full implementation, refer to the following files:
- [main.py](https://github.com/Jagadeesh-18-bot/Pokedex-application/blob/main/main.py)
- [search_window.py](https://github.com/Jagadeesh-18-bot/Pokedex-application/blob/main/search_window.py)

## Learning Outcome 🌟
This task taught me:
1. How to use **PySide6** to build user interfaces.
2. The power of **APIs** for fetching real-time data.
3. How to work with advanced Python modules and manage complex codebases.

Completing this task boosted my confidence, and I’m thrilled with how much I’ve learned and achieved! 🎉🔥
